Hiya, I'm Lucas, a Finnish person keen on learning more about different coding languages and coding in general. I am still pretty new to coding, but I've used Linux pretty extensively and i have coded a little in vocational school for some arduino projects.
My goal with learning to code is to be able to work in the space, since currently my skillset isn't something that's really seeked out by employers, even if I'm (i think at least) good at learning and problem solving.

Otherwise, I've messed around with 3d printing, I guess.
